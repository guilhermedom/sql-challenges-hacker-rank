/* Problem: Generate the following two result sets:

1. Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS,
immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a
parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example:
AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).

2. Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS.
Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the
following format:

There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation
in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If
more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be
ordered alphabetically.

Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of
occupation. */

-- First selection with names and first letter of occupation.
SELECT Concat(NAME, "(", LEFT(occupation, 1), ")")
FROM   occupations
ORDER  BY NAME;

-- Second selection with count of persons with occupation and name of
-- occupation.
SELECT Concat("there are a total of", Count(occupation), "", Lower(occupation)
       , "s.")
FROM   occupations
GROUP  BY occupation
ORDER  BY Count(occupation),
          occupation;
